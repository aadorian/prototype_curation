Prototye Curation Example

Datalog is a subset of Prolog that is primarily used for database-style reasoning, where facts and rules are defined, but without features like complex terms or backtracking that are present in Prolog. Datalog uses simpler syntax with only variables and constants, making it ideal for querying relational databases.


To create unit tests for Datalog, you'll need to simulate test cases by running queries against your Datalog facts and rules, and comparing the results with expected outcomes. Since Datalog doesn't have a built-in unit testing framework like some other languages, we can define a simple test structure by using queries that expect specific results and verifying if the outputs match the expected values.

Hereâ€™s how you can create unit testing for the Datalog facts and rules defined earlier.

Datalog Unit Testing
The basic idea for unit testing in Datalog is:

Define test cases using queries.
Compare the results of the queries with expected outputs.
Report whether the test passes or fails based on the comparison.

%run_tests.
